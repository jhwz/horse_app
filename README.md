# Horse Management App

Flutter app for data entry on horses for small lifestyle blocks. Built as an experimental project so is bound to be full of bugs and not following best practices!

As of now the app is not deployed on any app stores, so you will need to download the source and build with Flutter.

## Features

- Add horse profiles
- Add events related to horses
- Clean event viewing and management
- Export SQLite database to CSV, allows you to analyse the data in better software.
